# **Fine-Tuning-LLM**
Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Hugging Face Transformers. This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## **Overview**
Fine-tuning LLMs involves training pre-trained language models on specific tasks or datasets to improve their performance on those tasks. This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune LLMs using popular architectures like GPT-3, GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa, and others.

## **Requirements**
To run the code in this repository, you will need:

    Python (3.6 or higher)
    PyTorch (1.4.0 or higher)
    Hugging Face Transformers library (4.12.0 or higher)
    CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

  You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:
  
    pip install torch transformers

## **Getting Started**
  Clone this repository to your local machine:
  
    git clone https://github.com/valianttorch/LLMs-Sagemaker.git
    cd LLMs-Sagemaker

  Download a pre-trained LLM checkpoint from the Hugging Face model hub or use your own pre-trained checkpoint. <br>
  Prepare your dataset for fine-tuning. The dataset should be in a format suitable for the task you want to fine-tune the LLM on (e.g., text classification, text generation). <br>
  Run the fine-tuning script with appropriate arguments.

## **Usage**
  `fine_tune_llm.py`: Main script for fine-tuning LLMs. <br>
  `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation. <br>
  `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for running the code. <br>
  `LICENSE`: MIT License for the code in this repository.
